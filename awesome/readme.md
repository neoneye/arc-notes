This project captures the interaction history and continuesly updates the dataset with interaction histories.

## Tools

* [mxbi/arckit](https://github.com/mxbi/arckit) - Python and command-line tools for easily working with the ARC dataset.
* [arc-dsl](https://github.com/michaelhodel/arc-dsl) - Solutions to all 400 training tasks of the ARC dataset.
* [Console for inspecting ARC tasks](https://github.com/neoneye/arc-console) - Printing ARC images to the console can get messed up. Instead I have made a web server for viewing ARC images. It uses a websocket between the browser and the webserver (but you don't have to worry about the websocket). You can view an image by sending a POST request, and the image gets appended at the bottom of the web page.
