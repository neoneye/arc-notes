## Tools

* [Console for inspecting ARC tasks](https://github.com/neoneye/arc-console) - Printing ARC images to the console can get messed up. Instead I have made a web server for viewing ARC images. It uses a websocket between the browser and the webserver (but you don't have to worry about the websocket). You can view an image by sending a POST request, and the image gets appended at the bottom of the web page.
* [Predicting the output size of an ARC task](https://github.com/neoneye/arc-output-size) - Using the command line tool for making better guesses about the output size.
